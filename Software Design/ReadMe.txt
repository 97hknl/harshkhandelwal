This project was done in order to learn the concepts of modeling(UML) and its application in building a team project from scratch. This initiative was taken to learn how to make scalable, user oriented softwares.

This project concerns a group of mobile robots and a central station which take part in covering gridpoints in a given environment. The user may select the number of robots and obstacles he wishes to have in the environment and the system will then generate the specific world. The robots will follow a certain algorithm to cover the environment in forms of spirals and would finish when they hav covered at least 70% of the world.

The code for this can be found in Project\src\ROVU_Class_Diagram\Rovu_system .

A video demonstrating the system running is also present in the root directory.

The specific UML models corresponding to the project can be found under Project .
